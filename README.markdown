# Extending the Yahoo Streaming Benchmarks 


### Background
This code is a fork of the original [Yahoo! Streaming benchmark code](https://github.com/yahoo/streaming-benchmarks).






### Configuration
We've continued to use the benchmarkConf.yaml for all configuration.  You'll need to edit this file for your environment and also to control various parameters both for the load generators and the benchmarking programs.

### Results
For most of these benchmarks the results are collected using Yahoo's original scripts.  See that benchmark for more details.  In the case of the -FlinkState programs use the AkkaStateQuery program to retrieve the results.
